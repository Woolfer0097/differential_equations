Differential equations tasks for Innopolis course

Firstly you need to install poetry `pip install poetry` and then run `poetry install`

Now you can execute my code on python using poetry:

- To run first task code:
```poetry run python main.py```

- To run second task code:
```poetry run python task2.py```

You will get text output to file result.txt in both tasks after closing new window with graphical representation during the execution.
So result.txt will be available after execution of program. And graph - during the execution.
